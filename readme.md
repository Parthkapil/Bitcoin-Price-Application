# Bitcoin Price Application

This is a tkinter application that fetches sells and buys from different websites and plot them on
graph using matplotlib. The application shows live graph. It shows current Bitcoin price in the 
market. It can also be used for trading bitcoins like quick buy, quick sell etc , but that functionality is not supported yet as I am currently working on that.
